This set of Qemu management scripts is in proof of concept phase. It is not production ready.

## Preparing guest operating systems

Guest operating system should be installed with `noapic` setting for the kernel.
To do so follow these steps:

- Boot into the guest operating system
- Edit the following file: `/boot/grub2/grub.cnf`
- Locate kernel loading line ad append `noapic` setting. Line should look similar to this: 
`kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.18-194.el5 ro root=/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 rhgb quiet noapic acpi=off`
